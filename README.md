# Database
You will need to have setup a blank database call MyDatabase to connect to, it does nothing other than make a connection to the database

You must have SQL Server 2016 or later as your database.  The most common approach will be to import these files to an instance of SQL Server running on you local development workstation.  If you do not have a local install of SQL Server, you can download SQL Server Express from this link: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express)
